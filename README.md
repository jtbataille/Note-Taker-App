## Descriptio
This is an Express application which allows the busy user to create, save, and delete notes to help remember the important tasks of his/her day.

Upon opening this application for the first time, the user will be able to enter a note's title as well as its content. By clicking a disk icon in the upper right-hand corner of the screen, the user can save this note for later (as it will move to the sidebar on the left-hand side of the screen), keeping the note as long as desired, and begin writing another if need be. When the user returns, s/he will find the previous saved notes stored within the sidebar.

If the note is no longer needed, the user can click the small red trash icon on the right-most side of the saved note in order to permanentely delete the note, maintaining all the other notes that were previously saved.
